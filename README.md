# Deep Learning for Chest X-ray Classification

## Overview
This project aims to develop and evaluate deep learning pipelines for disease classification from medical imaging data, specifically chest X-ray images. The project implements and compares two advanced transformer-based architectures: Vision Mamba and SwinV2 Transformer. The goal is to enhance diagnostic accuracy through effective feature extraction and model optimization tailored to chest X-ray imagery.

## Objectives
- Implement Vision Mamba and SwinV2 Transformer architectures for chest X-ray classification.
- Evaluate the performance of both models using the ChestX-ray14 and VinDr-CXR datasets.
- Analyze and compare the results to determine the most effective approach for disease classification.

## Datasets
1. **ChestX-ray14**:
   - Contains 112,120 images from 30,805 unique patients with 14 disease labels.
   - Used as a benchmark for evaluating deep learning models.

2. **VinDr-CXR**:
   - Comprises 18,000 chest X-ray images with radiologist-verified annotations.
   - Provides bounding boxes for localization and disease labels for classification tasks.
